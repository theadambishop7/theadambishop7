### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about programming (specifically Python) and am tracking my study progress through [Pixe.la](https://pixe.la/v1/users/theadambishop/graphs/graph001.html):

I try and spend at least 1 hour every day focused on this learning. I'm not 100% consistent, but it's been pretty good!

ðŸ“£ Feel free to get in touch if you have questions or guidance!
